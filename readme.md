# pure flat assembler

This repository is a streamlined version of the FASM (Flat Assembler) project, focused exclusively on Linux x86_64 code. 

The goal is to remove any non-Linux x86_64 code from the original FASM source, enabling quick assembly and easier understanding of the assembler's inner workings on this platform.
